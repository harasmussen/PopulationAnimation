First R script written by Henrik Rasmssuen
It imports population data by age from CSV file and saaves a plot of each year to a png file. The frames can be converted to a GIF file using the Imagemagic software with the following command: 

> convert -delay 10 -loop 0 frame* population.gif

The result can be viewed here:
